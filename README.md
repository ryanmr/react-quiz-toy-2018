# React Quiz Toy

Every so often, my mom has a party at the house, usually around a theme. For the party, I provide on screen entertainment in the form of a quiz game.

This is the React and 2018 flavor.

## React Spring

I wanted to try using [React Spring](https://github.com/drcmda/react-spring). React Spring is a animation library for React that is super slick. I had some trouble with it implementing smoothly choreographed keyframe animations. I wanted to use it beyond what the demos could explain: adding a keyframe to a mapped child inside of an existing keyframe.

I put this branch on hold, but I thought it was worth saving somewhere.
